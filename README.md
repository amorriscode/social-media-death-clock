# Social Media Death Clock

## Memento Mori

> Memento mori is the medieval Latin Christian theory and practice of reflection on mortality, especially as a means of considering the vanity of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. It is related to the ars moriendi ("The Art of Dying") and similar Western literature. Memento mori has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.

This Chrome Extension helps users practice memento mori; a reflection on our mortality. When you go on social media, it will remind you how much time you have left by replacing website logos with a countdown to your inevitable end.

Being reminded of our transience allows us reflect on the things that we spend our time doing. Time is the only thing we cannot get back, how do you want to spend your time?
