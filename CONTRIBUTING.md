## Getting Started with Extension Development

Google [has a great tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) with getting started. I recommend you take a look at that.

In summary:

1. Open the Extension Management page (`chrome://extensions`)
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the Developer Mode toggle
3. Click `LOAD UNPACKED` and select the Social Media Death Clock folder
4. Have fun!
